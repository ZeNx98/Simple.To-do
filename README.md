# simpleTo-Do
simpleTo-Do is a simple C program that implements a command-line to-do list manager.
It allows users to add, view, edit, delete, search, and sort tasks, as well as save and load tasks from a file (tasks.txt).
Each task has an ID, completion status, name, and description.
The program uses a singly linked list to manage tasks in memory and provides basic persistence by reading from and writing to a text file.

Features:

Add new tasks
View all tasks
Edit or delete tasks by ID
Mark tasks as done
Delete all completed tasks
Save/load tasks to/from a file
(Stubs for search and sort functionality)
